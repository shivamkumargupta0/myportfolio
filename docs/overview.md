#  Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website created to represent my skills, education, projects, and professional information online.  
The goal was to learn how to properly structure a web project, use **Visual Studio Code** for development, and manage source control using **Git and GitHub**.

###  Project Goals
- Build a clean and responsive static website
- Implement Git commands such as `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
- Host the project on GitHub with proper documentation
- Maintain at least 5 meaningful commits with descriptive messages
